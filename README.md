# EnergyTrackr Results

This repository contains the raw and processed energy measurement results collected using the **EnergyTrackr** pipeline, as part of the master's thesis _"Systematic Detection of Energy Regressions in Java Projects and Identification of Regression Code Patterns"_ by François Bechet (Université de Namur / TU Delft).

The goal of this dataset is to support reproducibility and future research on energy-aware software development, energy regressions, and green coding practices.

NOTE: Most of the configuration files are in .json format because initially this is the format used by the EnergyTrackr pipeline. However, now the EnergyTrackr pipeline uses .yaml files for configuration. The .json files are kept for reference but should still be usable with the EnergyTrackr pipeline and can be converted to .yaml format if needed.

NOTE 2: The data used for the thesis is in the following directories:

- `java/fastexcel`
- `java/jsoup`
- `java/univocity-parsers`
