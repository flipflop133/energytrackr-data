# EnergyTrackr Results

This repository contains the raw and processed energy measurement results collected using the **EnergyTrackr** pipeline, as part of the master's thesis _"Systematic Detection of Energy Regressions in Java Projects and Identification of Regression Code Patterns"_ by François Bechet (Université de Namur / TU Delft).

The goal of this dataset is to support reproducibility and future research on energy-aware software development, energy regressions, and green coding practices.
