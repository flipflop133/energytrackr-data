Data was collected in multiple times for convenience over a 2000+ commits history. For convenience, the data was merged into a single csv file to produce a single html report file.
merged.csv was assembled from the files sorted_x.csv in the separate-data directory.
The legacy-data directory contains the data collected during building of the energytrackr project, it is only kept for reference and is not used in the report.
